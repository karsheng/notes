# Programming Foundations With Python

## Intro
1. Type IDLE at terminal to open the python development environment.
1. Python Standard Library for Documentation. Make sure the version is correct.
1. Use Python Shell window to do experiment.
1. [`string.translate`](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_translate.htm)
1. Need to be careful with the current working directory. Use `os.getcwd()` to check. Upon switching current working directory, remember to switch it back if necessary.
1. An error thrown is called Exception if.... 
1. Info on [Exceptions](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_exceptions.htm).
1. Hiding of detail behind documentation, in computer science, is called abstraction.


## Classes
1. A module called turtle -> moves things around and draw stuff on computer.
1. [Twillio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/python) - use to program communication: text(SMS), voice and video and authentication APIs 
1. Use `from..import` for direct access of attributes. Link to [documentation](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_modules.htm).
1. [wdylike checks profanity](http://www.wdylike.appspot.com/?q=shit)
1. [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
1. When you call a class, you're essentially calling the init (constructor) function that creates space in memory for a new instance or a new Object of the class.
1. `__init__` is a special function reserved in Python - to initialize and create space in memory for the instance its about to create.
1. `self` is the instance created - basically like `this` in JS.
1. Instance variables(variables) and instance methods (functions)
1. Google style guide for naming constant: ALL CAPS!
1. `__doc__` shows documentation, use triple quotes to write documentations.
1. [More info](http://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/courses/python/class/5/) on predefined class attributes
1.  Method overriding - a subclass override functions or variables inherited from a parent class.
