# To find out

1. Difference between train and validation set.

1. LSTM

1. What is `dropout` in `tflearn.lstm(net, 128, dropout=0.8)`
A technique that helps prevent overfitting by randomly turning on and off different pathways in our network

1. What is `tflearn.fully_connected(net, 2, activation='softmax')` for?
Every neuron in the previous layer (`net`) is connected to every neuron in this layer. Having a fully connected layer is a computationally cheap way of learning non-linear combinations of them.
1. What is the `adam` optimizer and `categorical_crossentropy` in `tflearn.regression(net, optimizer='adam', learning_rate=0.0001, loss='categorical_crossentropy')`
